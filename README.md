# Nonstationary S-Map (NS-Map)

This repository contains the data and code associated with the paper "Quantifying nonstationarity in ecological time series" by Kenneth Gee, Tanya Rogers, and Stephan Munch. This method extends S-map empirical dynamic modeling to nonstationary systems through the introduction of a modified weighting kernel.
