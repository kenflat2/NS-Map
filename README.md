# NS-Map
Official codebase for NS-Map, as introduced in the paper Identifying Nonstationarity in Ecological Time Series.

#What is it?

NS-Map is a tool for forecasting nonstationary ecological time series, and identifying whether a given series is nonstationary. This package includes the source code for the original implementation of NSMap, as well as various Jupyter Notebooks which execute the simulation experiments and real ecological data analysis specified in the paper.

You may get started by looking through the Jupyter notebooks to see how predictions are made and nonstationarity is assessed. If you want to do you own analysis with NSMap, you may install the package using pip install NSMap (https://pypi.org/project/NSMap/).
