# Nonstationary S-Map (NS-Map)

This repository contains the data and code associated with the paper "Quantifying nonstationarity in ecological time series" by Kenneth Gee, Tanya Rogers, and Stephan Munch. This method extends S-map empirical dynamic modeling to nonstationary systems through the introduction of a modified weighting kernel.

This package includes the source code for the original implementation of NSMap, as well as various Jupyter Notebooks which execute the simulation experiments and ecological data analysis specified in the paper.

You may get started by looking through the Jupyter notebooks to see how predictions are made and nonstationarity is assessed. If you want to do you own analysis with NSMap, you may install the package using pip install NSMap (https://pypi.org/project/NSMap/).
